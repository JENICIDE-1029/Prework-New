# PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website was created with the motivation to practice and understand the components that make up a website while also being the host to the notes regarding the exact same subjects. In other words, the practice project also became the same place to store in notes about the project. The intention behind all of this was to act as a learning aid in the complexity that comes with building websites for the first time. Which solves the solution of helping confused students, like myself, in getting a clearer understanding of what all I'm doing. 

I feel like I got the inside-scoop about wesbites and appreciate them in a much more different light. It's fascinating to learn about all of these components and their specific rules to make them work cohesively. Overall, I'd say that I learned a TON while making this website but the thing that has stuck with me the most was learning about growth mindsets over in module 1 of this project (nothing to do with this website, but hang in there) because it truly shaped my mentality towards learning in a completely new light that helped me navigate through the entirety of this prework study guide website.
